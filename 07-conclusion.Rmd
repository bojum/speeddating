# Conclusion

## Limitations

There are several issues with the dataset. First, one part of the dataset is a questionaire about subjective matters. This potentially introduces bias to the dataset and invalidates the results. Second, the dataset, although very interesting, is almost 20 years old. Relationships among variables have have changed over the years. Third, there is an obvious selection bias in during the process of data collecting. Only students are included in the experiment. Outgoing people are more likely to participate. Moreover, the setting that only pairs female and male students together excludes a large group of people who do not identify themselves as any binary genders. As a result, what we find in the analyses may not be applicable to nowadays. 

## Future Directions

The current findings in the analyses 
The first next step we would like to do is to conduct statistical tests to verify some conclusions we found. 

As mentioned in limitations section that things change over time, if we could gather a similar set of data from the present time, we would like to run the same study on it and compare changes in trends.

1. Study a similar dataset from the present time to see if the trend changes.
2. more study on how a person's expectation in his/her partner changes after dating/mathcing 
3. more study on factors other than what has been explored (attribute scores, shared interest, gender). Something that is uneasily quantified.  
4. Add more interactive components to engage audience
no statistical tests have been done so the conclusion may not be valid

Lesson learned
1. Coding in d3 takes a lot of time than we expected
2. GitHub workflow can be improved
3. Choosing appropriate forms of graphs is critical. Findings varies or may be unnoticeable.
4. Help document and online resources are very important and helpful to our project. E.g. there are many ways to visualize missing value pattern. Packages bahave differently and we need to pick the right one for our project. e.g. mi can produce nice plots but it is not suitable for our project.
