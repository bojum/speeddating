## Dating 101: increasing your chance of getting more matches in Speed Dating

What is love at first sight? Imagine meeting a girl or a guy that you really like, and you want to make a better impression. How should you act out? How do you know if you are a good match for him/her? This project will help you understand what are the important factors that will help you make a better impression.

In this project, we explore what factors that influence the chances of getting a “match.” For example, will having a same hobby with your partner increase your chances? Or should you behave as confident you can to leave a better impression? If not, what things or factors are your partner looking for? We derive our focus on the factors that you can control.
