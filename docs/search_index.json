Imagine meeting a girl or a guy that you really like, and you want to make a better impression. How should you act out? How do you know if you are a good match for him/her? This project will help you understand what are the important factors that will help you make a better impression. 1.2 Background We use experimental Speed Dating data collected by Columbia Business schooll as a foundation to the analyses in this project. Being popular since 1970s, speed dating is a formalized matchmaking process which enables singles to meet large numbers of new potential partners in a very short period of time (4 minutes in our data), which is equivalent to having many “first sights” and being able to choose the potential partners that you like. If both participants like each other, then it is a “match” and they can exchange contact information and such. For research purposes, participants in our data were asked to fill out several forms before, during, and after the speed dating process. Our findings are based on such data. 1.3 Our Goal In this project, we explore factors that influence the chances of getting a “match.” For example, will having a same hobby with your partner increase your chances? Or should you behave as confident as you can to leave a better impression? If not, what things or factors are your partner looking for? We derive our focus on the factors that you can control. 1.4 Project Overview In section 2, we give an overview of our data, where it was from and what issues it may have. Then in section 3 and 4, we describe our data cleaning/transformation process and patterns for missing values. In section 5, we provide our analyses and interesting findings, and the answers to those questions above will be in this section as well. In section 6, we include interative components of the analyses, where you can interact with the graphs and explore interesting findings on your own. We include our conclusions to this project in section 7. "],
["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources 2.1 Experimental Design 2.2 Data Description", " Chapter 2 Data sources The dataset for our project is speed dating dataset provided by Anna Montoya. It is publicly available on [Data.com] as an excel file. The data contains information about questionnaires filled out before, during and after a speed dating experiment in 2002-2004, which was run by professor Ray Fisman and Sheena Iyengar from Columbia Business School. The primary purpose of the experiment was discussed in their paper Gender Differences in Mate Selection: Evidence From a Speed Dating Experiment. 2.1 Experimental Design The experiment design was based on the format of a Speed Dating event, where male participants and female participants have a one-to-one four-minute conversation and decide if they want to meet each other again. They will get the other’s contact information only if both parties “accept”. Each participant will meet a large number of participants of opposite sex during the experiment. Subjects in this experiments were students in graduate and professional school at Columbia University during the time of the experiment. They learned about the event through mass e-mail and fliers on distributed on campus. They had to sign up for the event by providing their names and email addresses and completing a pre-event survey on website, which requires the following information: Gender, Location, Income, Age, etc. Their interests in 17 hobbies listed to them Their self-evaluation There were 20 sessions of the experiment, all of which had the same setting. All participants were randomly assigned to one of the sessions. On the session day, participants who are unawared of the total number of participants on that day had to fill in a scorecard that contains: Spaces to write the ID number of each person they met Yes/No whether a subject wants to meet the person again Six attributes on which a subject was to rate the person they met. The attributes are: Attractive Sincere Intelligent Fun Ambitious Shared Interests There were roughly the same number of female and male participants in each sessions. Subjects only had conversation with those of different genders. Female subjects would meet all male subjects in the session. The scorecard was to be filled after each four-minute conversation. The day after the Speed Dating event, particiapants were asked to complete the follow-up online questionaire in order to obtain their matches. For more details on the experiment procedure, please check out the study. 2.2 Data Description The raw dataset from the source has 195 variables and 8378 rows. The number of rows do not represent the total number of participants in the experiment. The data provider had transformed the dataset by gathering to match some variables between a subject and each of its partner. We have further cleaned the dataset so that it includes only important variables (see more detail in data cleaning section). Variables in the analysis is summarized in the metadata below.

["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation 3.1 Filter 3.2 Transformation", " Chapter 3 Data transformation The raw dataset contains 195 variables with 8378 rows. Only a subset of 195 variables is included in our analysis (more detail for this step in data transformation section). We would like to note that each row represents one meeting (from the perspective of one participant). The script file that we used to clean and transform the dataset can be found here. 3.1 Filter First, out of the 195 variables (columns), we only keep 70 of them using dplyr::select function. Those 70 variables include their basic information (id, gender, age, race…), their self-evaluation scores, their interests in listed hobbies, and the evalution scores they received from partners (partipants of opposite sex). 3.2 Transformation Next, we want to know whether each participant’s partner share common interests in listed hobbies as the participant, and have this data available in respective indicator columns. However, partner’s data is not available as variables in the same row as the participant. Luckily, for each entry in the data, the partner’s interests in listed hobbies can be found under partner’s entry (a different row). So in order to do this, we’d have to look up participant’s partner’s hobby-data in a different row using partner’s id. We then check whether both participant and partner in each hobby is at least 7 (on a scale from 1 t 10), if so, we enter “Yes” to the indicator column of this hobby, else no. This process is done using do.call, cbind, and lapply. We do the same for participants basic information. But due to the complexity of the naming of those variables, it is done using a for loop instead of using do.call, cbind, and lapply. "],
["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values", " Chapter 4 Missing values The columns with the most missing data is the questions about the six attributes in expectation (attr:shar) and five attributes in self-evaluation (attr:sinc) answered two weeks after the dating, and they have the same missing patterns because they were asked at the same time. Due to the large number of missings in these columns, we drop questions asked two weeks after the datings in most of our analysis (only include them once to see the change over time). There are 13 more missing patterns in rows, each of which missed only a small part of data, when analyzing these varibles, we would simply filter out the missing data. "],
["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Will Backrgound and Common Interests Influence the Match? Which Feature is the Most Influential? 5.2 How Males and Females’ Expectation and Self-Evaluation Differ? 5.3 Do People with Excess Self-Esteem Get More Romantic Interest?", " Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Will Backrgound and Common Interests Influence the Match? Which Feature is the Most Influential? The following interactive component compares the proportion of matches based on whether the participant and partner share the listed feature*. This graph is also available in section 6. Most variables do not have an impact on the chance of matching whether they share this feature or not. In fact, sharing the hobby of watching movies negatively impacts the chance of matching, potentially due to the fact that male participants having watching movies as a hobby indicates that his work is not as demanding, or that he is not ambitious with his career. However, if a participant and partner are both from the same location, their chance of matching almost double the rate of matching (although with a very small sample size). This is probably because their cost of relocation is minimized if they were to move forward with their relationship. Plus, they will also have a lot of common topics to talk about, which could drastically help feel like they are from the same community. We then look at all the available hobbies that could be of common interest in the dataset, and see if any of those features heavily impacts the chances of getting matched. They following graph demonstrates the chance of matching depending on whether both participants share the same hobby or not. As we can see from the graph, yoga and clubbing are both crucial factors that could swing the chance of getting matched to your favor. Considering those are nitch hobbies, it makes sense that the rarity of finding someone with the same interest raises your interest for your partner. Even if they are not interested in dating, there is a possibility that they could be asnwering yes to exchange contact information just to be normal friends. On the other hand, we can see that hobbies such as gaming, tvsports, shopping and movies can be considered a negative factor. As those hobbies are less likely to yield positive impact in one’s career and financial situations, which could be an important factor. So even if you are fan of those hobbies, it is best not to mention it during first dates. 5.2 How Males and Females’ Expectation and Self-Evaluation Differ? From the plot we found that only a small proportion of people participate in the experiment for dating, which meant they may not treat the dating seriously and just choose their partners randomly. So in this section, we explored whether people really chose to date with someone that meet their expectation, or they made their decision basing on other factors, and is there a difference between male and female. Another thing we were interested in is would males and females’ self-evaluation be influenced after they dating with someone. We define expectation as how people weight the importance of some attributes of their partners, and define self-evaluation of how people score their performance on those attributes. In this experiment people were asked their opinions about six attributes, which we descibed in section 2.2, to represent their expectation and five attributes to represent their self-evaluation (“share hobby” is dropped). Expectations How Does Males and Females’ Expectation Change Before and After Datings? In this part, we analyzed the weights of expectation in six attributes (attractive, sincere, intelligent, fun, ambitious and shared hobbies) between males and females, and how did the weight change after meeting someone. By analyzing the expectation before and after the dating by gender, we found: For both female and male, intelligence, sincerity and fun are important attributes they expected to see in their partners. Female attached much more importance to ambition of their partners than male do, while male attached much more importance to attractivity of the partners than female do. There is no large difference of the expections after the datings. But the weight of attraction increased slightly in both female and male groups. To test whether these change last for a long time, we continued to do the following exploratory. Do the Changes Last for a Long time? To check does the dating have a long-term influence on people’s expectations towards their partners, we did an analysis basing on the observations who answered the questions two weeks after. Although only part of the participants answered the questions again two weeks after the dating, there is still 6800 records (449 individuals). From the graph we found that one-time dating only has a short-term influence on people’s expectations towards their partners. As time pass by, their expectations tended to come back to the level before the datings. This finding is reasonable since they were only one-time datings. However, to get a conclusion about whether people’s mind change after dating, we need to seperate the groups into matched and unmatched. There is no obvious difference between the expections of matched group and unmatched groups, which means whether people are on a dating or not does not influence their expections to their partners (if they are not dating secretly or with another person except for the one they meet in this event). Self-evaluation How Does Self-Evaluation Change Before and After Datings? Does match influence changes in self-evaluation? There is no large difference in self-evaluation regrading to the five attributes (ambitious, attractive, fun, intelligent and sincere) between females and males before and after the datings, nor the matching results influence their self-evaluation. Does the Expectation Influence Whether or not They Decide to Date? Usually people choose to date with someone because he/she has some attributes that attract them. It is likely that people will choose to date with someone who have the expective attributes. To test this assumption, we did the following exploratory. If people made their decisions based on the score they gave, for people they said “yes”, the score for them should be higher than for those they said “no”. But according to the graph, there is no difference between the distribution of the score between “yes” and “no” groups, even if we seperate people by their goal of participating the event excpet for the female groups whose goal is dating. In the female groups whose goal is dating, they tent to date with people who had higher scores. What Influence Their Decisions? The graph above shows that score and a good impression (like) of a person has a positive relationship, which means if scores did not influence people’s decisions, a good impression mattered little. The first graph shows how much do people like their partners. And the second graph shows how likely do people think their partner would like to date with them, namely, say “yes” to them. The graph on the right side is the number of people who gave the score. We use yes-no ratio (the number of people who said “yes” against those who said “no”) to denote the decision of the group. If the ratio is larger than one, means among the people who gave the score, the majority of them want to date with partners. From the graph, we confirmed that whether or not a person like his/her partner did not have a large influence on his/her decision, namely, they did date with someone they like best. Instead, they tended to choose those who might like them. For females, if they thought a male was 70% likely to say “yes” to themselves, they will also say “yes”. For males, if they thought a female was 80% likely to say “yes” to themselves, they will also say “yes”. 5.3 Do People with Excess Self-Esteem Get More Romantic Interest? Self-enhancement is one kind of motivations that makes people feel good and boosts their confidence (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-enhancement). Epley and Whitchurch’s work is one evidence supporting the idea that people tend to see themselves better that the reality (https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0146167208318601?journalCode=pspc). The phenomenon is also known as “illusory superiority”, where the majority of people evaluates themself as better than the average. It is widely believed that confident people preform better in various tasks including in relationships (see Link). This section of the analysis focuses on this idea. Specifically, we want to know if confident people get more interests during the Speed Dating session. Given the dataset, we define confidence, or excess self-esteem, as how much higher a subject evaluates itself than other people rate the subject (peer score). That is, the varaible excess self-esteem is calculated by subtracting an averaged evaluation score given by others from the score given to self. A large positive difference indicates highly excess self-esteem. A large negative difference suggests very low self-esteem. The variable is called self-esteem in the analysis and peer score is an average score a subject received from other people. http://images.lipy.com/women-vs-men One distinct characteristics of participants is gender. However, the previous question found no difference between genders. Moreover, this characteristics does not distinguish subjects in terms of their excess self-esteem. Below are distributions of score differences for each gender in each attribute. Their distribution are similar, peaking at around 1 with almost identical spread. When self-esteem is plotted against the proportion of people who want to meet with a subject again, referred to as interest proportion, the only small difference between gender is that female participants tend to get higher interest proportion than male participants. This is shown by more red dots locating at the top and more blue dots at the bottom of the graph. However, dots at the top and the bottom constitute only a small number of participants. Therefore, this analysis treat both genders collectively. The plots above also suggest that people with excess self-esteem generally have low interest proportion. The correlation is stronger in fun and attractive, with the most negative correlation in attractive. That is, a participant with lower self-esteem in his/her own attractive and fun tends to get more romatic interest from the others. Attribute Correlation Attractive -0.1857069 Sincere -0.4475117 Ambitious -0.2780918 Fun -0.3056818 Intelligent -0.1804723 The fact that attractive has the strongest correlation with interest proportion should not be surprising since it is the attribute that people look for the most in their partner (discussed in previous question). The next part narrows its focus down to attractive attribute only. Below is a plot of peer score against interest proportion. Data points are colored by self esteem. Darker color indicates a person with lower self-esteem. The plot shows a linear relationship between peer evaluation score and interest proportion. A person who, other people think, is attractive gain more romantic interest proportion, especially when the average score is below 5. The linear relationship becomes weaker for those with score larger than 6. We also found that people who are less confident in their attractiveness tend to get more interests. This is shown by darker dots at the top right of the plot. Poeple with low self-esteem gain more proportion of interest. Before jumping into a conclusion that being attractive is what matters, we inspect other characteristics of subjects. We are curious about whether there are some confounding varaibles (other than what has been explored in the previous questions) that get a subject more romantic interest. All the graphs below are relationships between peer score on attractive and interest proportion. Dots are colored by other characterisitcs that we want to inspect. 5.3.0.1 Race We find no pattern among proportion, peer_score, and race. 5.3.0.2 Field of Study In addition to considering individual majors, we create major categories to see any general pattern that involves in school majors. There is also no pattern among proportion, peer_score, and study field. As far as we know, attractiveness is the only characteristic that have the strongest correlation with interest propotion. In conclusion, we found that people with low self-esteem in their attractiveness gain more romantic interest after the event. "],
["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 6 Interactive component", " Chapter 6 Interactive component The following interactive component compares the proportion of matches based on whether the participant and partner share the listed feature*. This graph is also available in section 5. Most variables do not have an impact on the chance of matching no matter whether they share this feature or not. In fact, sharing the hobby of watching movies negatively impacts the chance of matching, which is potentially due to the fact that male participants having watching movies as a hobby indicates that his work is not demanding, or that he is not ambitious with his career. However, one feature almost double the rate of matching (although with a very small sample size). Click and find out! Made using D3 For sports, reading and movies, both participant and his/her partner having an interest of at least 7 (from a scale of 1 to 10) is considered sharing the feature. "],
["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion 7.1 Limitations 7.2 Future Directions 7.3 Lesson Learned", " Chapter 7 Conclusion 7.1 Limitations There are several issues with the dataset that we use. First, a part of the dataset is a questionaire about subjective matters. For instance, two people do not rate the same level of attractive with the same score. This potentially introduces bias to the dataset and invalidates the results. Second, the dataset, although very interesting, is almost 20 years old. Relationships among variables may have changed over the years. Besides, there is an obvious selection bias during the process of data collecting. Only students are included in the experiment. Outgoing people are more likely to participate. Moreover, the setting that only pairs female and male students together excludes a large group of people who do not identify themselves as any binary genders. As a result, what we find in the analyses may not be applicable to nowadays. 7.2 Future Directions The first next step would be to include more interactive components to the analyses to highlight the findings and engage readers. Some current findings in the analyses are not evident enough. This suggests that there may be more factors that we should explore. Based on our results, any appearance features, such as the way participants talk and walk or their postures, are good candidates although these are not easily quantified. If possible, we also would like to conduct statistical tests to verify conclusions we found. As mentioned in limitations section that things change over time, we find that this is a good topic that we can extend our project towards. If we could gather a similar set of data from the present time, we would like to run the same study on it and compare changes in trends. 7.3 Lesson Learned There are a lot we have learned from working on this project. We are aware that interactive part is very important to engage readers. However, to create an interactive graph that can appropriately demonstrate our intent using D3 takes a lot longer time than we expected. Some of the graphs were dropped from the final version because we find static versions better suited our purpose. GitHub can be a very useful resource when working collaboratively, but at the same time, it can cause a number of issues that require us some times to fix. We have to overwrite the entire remote master branch to get over some problems. When we move from EDA to presentation, we find that choosing appropriate forms of graphs is greatly critical. We need to pick presentations for the results that are easy for readers to understand. Nonetheless, we sometimes find that presentations that highlight the results the most are not comprehensive. It is hard to judge where is the right balance between easy-to-read and impactful outcomes. "]
